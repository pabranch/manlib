    <para>
      BIO_s_bio() returns the method for a BIO pair. A BIO pair is a pair
      of source/sink BIOs where data written to either half of the pair is
      buffered and can be read from the other half. Both halves must
      usually by handled by the same application thread since no locking is
      done on the internal data structures.
    </para>
    <para>
      Since BIO chains typically end in a source/sink BIO it is possible to
      make this one half of a BIO pair and have all the data processed by
      the chain under application control.
    </para>
    <para>
      One typical use of BIO pairs is to place TLS/SSL I/O under
      application control, this can be used when the application wishes to
      use a non standard transport for TLS/SSL or the normal socket
      routines are inappropriate.
    </para>
    <para>
      Calls to BIO_read() will read data from the buffer or request a retry
      if no data is available.
    </para>
    <para>
      Calls to BIO_write() will place data in the buffer or request a retry
      if the buffer is full.
    </para>
    <para>
      The standard calls BIO_ctrl_pending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() can be
      used to determine the amount of pending data in the read or write
      buffer.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_reset() clears any data in the write buffer.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_make_bio_pair() joins two separate BIOs into a connected pair.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_destroy_pair() destroys the association between two connected
      BIOs. Freeing up any half of the pair will automatically destroy the
      association.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_shutdown_wr() is used to close down a BIO <emphasis role="bold">b</emphasis>. After this call no further writes on BIO
      <emphasis role="bold">b</emphasis> are allowed (they will return an
      error). Reads on the other half of the pair will return any pending
      data or EOF when all pending data has been read.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_set_write_buf_size() sets the write buffer size of BIO <emphasis role="bold">b</emphasis> to <emphasis role="bold">size</emphasis>. If
      the size is not initialized a default value is used. This is
      currently 17K, sufficient for a maximum size TLS record.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_get_write_buf_size() returns the size of the write buffer.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_new_bio_pair() combines the calls to BIO_new(),
      BIO_make_bio_pair() and BIO_set_write_buf_size() to create a
      connected pair of BIOs <emphasis role="bold">bio1</emphasis>,
      <emphasis role="bold">bio2</emphasis> with write buffer sizes
      <emphasis role="bold">writebuf1</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">writebuf2</emphasis>. If either size is zero then the
      default size is used.  BIO_new_bio_pair() does not check whether
      <emphasis role="bold">bio1</emphasis> or <emphasis role="bold">bio2</emphasis> do point to some other BIO, the values
      are overwritten, BIO_free() is not called.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_get_write_guarantee() and BIO_ctrl_get_write_guarantee() return
      the maximum length of data that can be currently written to the BIO.
      Writes larger than this value will return a value from BIO_write()
      less than the amount requested or if the buffer is full request a
      retry. BIO_ctrl_get_write_guarantee() is a function whereas
      BIO_get_write_guarantee() is a macro.
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_get_read_request() and BIO_ctrl_get_read_request() return the
      amount of data requested, or the buffer size if it is less, if the
      last read attempt at the other half of the BIO pair failed due to an
      empty buffer.  This can be used to determine how much data should be
      written to the BIO so the next read will succeed: this is most useful
      in TLS/SSL applications where the amount of data read is usually
      meaningful rather than just a buffer size. After a successful read
      this call will return zero.  It also will return zero once new data
      has been written satisfying the read request or part of it. Note that
      BIO_get_read_request() never returns an amount larger than that
      returned by BIO_get_write_guarantee().
    </para>
    <para>
      BIO_ctrl_reset_read_request() can also be used to reset the value
      returned by BIO_get_read_request() to zero.
    </para>
  </refsection>
  <refsection xml:id="ID-6bc380de9d990ece7ec1d0f584865540"><title>NOTES</title>
    <para>
      Both halves of a BIO pair should be freed. That is even if one half
      is implicit freed due to a BIO_free_all() or SSL_free() call the
      other half needs to be freed.
    </para>
    <para>
      When used in bidirectional applications (such as TLS/SSL) care should
      be taken to flush any data in the write buffer. This can be done by
      calling BIO_pending() on the other half of the pair and, if any data
      is pending, reading it and sending it to the underlying transport.
      This must be done before any normal processing (such as calling
      select() ) due to a request and BIO_should_read() being true.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see why this is important consider a case where a request is sent
      using BIO_write() and a response read with BIO_read(), this can occur
      during an TLS/SSL handshake for example. BIO_write() will succeed and
      place data in the write buffer. BIO_read() will initially fail and
      BIO_should_read() will be true. If the application then waits for
      data to be available on the underlying transport before flushing the
      write buffer it will never succeed because the request was never
      sent!

      BIO_new_bio_pair() returns 1 on success, with the new BIOs available

      stored into the locations for <emphasis role="bold">bio1</emphasis>

    <para>
      The BIO pair can be used to have full control over the network access
      of an application. The application can call select() on the socket as
      required without having to go through the SSL-interface.
    </para>

    <para>
      As the BIO pair will only buffer the data and never directly access
      the connection, it behaves non-blocking and will return as soon as
      the write buffer is full or the read buffer is drained. Then the
      application has to flush the write buffer and/or fill the read
      buffer.
    </para>
    <para>
      Use the BIO_ctrl_pending(), to find out whether data is buffered in
      the BIO and must be transferred to the network. Use
      BIO_ctrl_get_read_request() to find out, how many bytes must be
      written into the buffer before the SSL_operation() can successfully
      be continued.
    </para>
  </refsection>
  <refsection xml:id="ID-7cf438a03f0a2ef0fdd4ea326862a09a"><title>WARNING</title>
    <para>
      As the data is buffered, SSL_operation() may return with a
      ERROR_SSL_WANT_READ condition, but there is still data in the write
      buffer. An application must not rely on the error value of
      SSL_operation() but must assure that the write buffer is always
      flushed first. Otherwise a deadlock may occur as the peer might be
      waiting for the data before being able to continue.
