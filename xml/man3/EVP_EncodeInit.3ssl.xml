    <para>
      The EVP encode routines provide a high level interface to base 64
      encoding and decoding. Base 64 encoding converts binary data into a
      printable form that uses the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "+" and "/" to
      represent the data. For every 3 bytes of binary data provided 4 bytes
      of base 64 encoded data will be produced plus some occasional
      newlines (see below). If the input data length is not a multiple of 3
      then the output data will be padded at the end using the "="
      character.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_ENCODE_CTX_new() allocates, initializes and returns a context to
      be used for the encode/decode functions.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_ENCODE_CTX_free() cleans up an encode/decode context <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> and frees up the space allocated to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Encoding of binary data is performed in blocks of 48 input bytes (or
      less for the final block). For each 48 byte input block encoded 64
      bytes of base 64 data is output plus an additional newline character
      (i.e. 65 bytes in total). The final block (which may be less than 48
      bytes) will output 4 bytes for every 3 bytes of input. If the data
      length is not divisible by 3 then a full 4 bytes is still output for
      the final 1 or 2 bytes of input. Similarly a newline character will
      also be output.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_EncodeInit() initialises <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> for
      the start of a new encoding operation.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_EncodeUpdate() encode <emphasis role="bold">inl</emphasis> bytes
      of data found in the buffer pointed to by <emphasis role="bold">in</emphasis>. The output is stored in the buffer
      <emphasis role="bold">out</emphasis> and the number of bytes output
      is stored in <emphasis role="bold">*outl</emphasis>. It is the
      caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer at <emphasis role="bold">out</emphasis> is sufficiently large to accommodate the
      output data. Only full blocks of data (48 bytes) will be immediately
      processed and output by this function. Any remainder is held in the
      <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> object and will be processed by
      a subsequent call to EVP_EncodeUpdate() or EVP_EncodeFinal(). To
      calculate the required size of the output buffer add together the
      value of <emphasis role="bold">inl</emphasis> with the amount of
      unprocessed data held in <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> and
      divide the result by 48 (ignore any remainder). This gives the number
      of blocks of data that will be processed. Ensure the output buffer
      contains 65 bytes of storage for each block, plus an additional byte
      for a NUL terminator. EVP_EncodeUpdate() may be called repeatedly to
      process large amounts of input data. In the event of an error
      EVP_EncodeUpdate() will set <emphasis role="bold">*outl</emphasis> to
      0.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_EncodeFinal() must be called at the end of an encoding operation.
      It will process any partial block of data remaining in the <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> object. The output data will be stored in
      <emphasis role="bold">out</emphasis> and the length of the data
      written will be stored in <emphasis role="bold">*outl</emphasis>. It
      is the caller's responsibility to ensure that <emphasis role="bold">out</emphasis> is sufficiently large to accommodate the
      output data which will never be more than 65 bytes plus an additional
      NUL terminator (i.e. 66 bytes in total).
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_ENCODE_CTX_num() will return the number of as yet unprocessed
      bytes still to be encoded or decoded that are pending in the
      <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> object.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_EncodeBlock() encodes a full block of input data in <emphasis role="bold">f</emphasis> and of length <emphasis role="bold">dlen</emphasis> and stores it in <emphasis role="bold">t</emphasis>. For every 3 bytes of input provided 4 bytes
      of output data will be produced. If <emphasis role="bold">dlen</emphasis> is not divisible by 3 then the block is
      encoded as a final block of data and the output is padded such that
      it is always divisible by 4. Additionally a NUL terminator character
      will be added. For example if 16 bytes of input data is provided then
      24 bytes of encoded data is created plus 1 byte for a NUL terminator
      (i.e. 25 bytes in total). The length of the data generated <emphasis role="italic">without</emphasis> the NUL terminator is returned from
      the function.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_DecodeInit() initialises <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> for
      the start of a new decoding operation.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_DecodeUpdate() decodes <emphasis role="bold">inl</emphasis>
      characters of data found in the buffer pointed to by <emphasis role="bold">in</emphasis>. The output is stored in the buffer
      <emphasis role="bold">out</emphasis> and the number of bytes output
      is stored in <emphasis role="bold">*outl</emphasis>. It is the
      caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer at <emphasis role="bold">out</emphasis> is sufficiently large to accommodate the
      output data. This function will attempt to decode as much data as
      possible in 4 byte chunks. Any whitespace, newline or carriage return
      characters are ignored. Any partial chunk of unprocessed data (1, 2
      or 3 bytes) that remains at the end will be held in the <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> object and processed by a subsequent call
      to EVP_DecodeUpdate(). If any illegal base 64 characters are
      encountered or if the base 64 padding character "=" is encountered in
      the middle of the data then the function returns -1 to indicate an
      error. A return value of 0 or 1 indicates successful processing of
      the data. A return value of 0 additionally indicates that the last
      input data characters processed included the base 64 padding
      character "=" and therefore no more non-padding character data is
      expected to be processed. For every 4 valid base 64 bytes processed
      (ignoring whitespace, carriage returns and line feeds), 3 bytes of
      binary output data will be produced (or less at the end of the data
      where the padding character "=" has been used).
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_DecodeFinal() must be called at the end of a decoding operation.
      If there is any unprocessed data still in <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis> then the input data must not have been a
      multiple of 4 and therefore an error has occurred. The function will
      return -1 in this case. Otherwise the function returns 1 on success.
    </para>
    <para>
      EVP_DecodeBlock() will decode the block of <emphasis role="bold">n</emphasis> characters of base 64 data contained in
      <emphasis role="bold">f</emphasis> and store the result in <emphasis role="bold">t</emphasis>. Any leading whitespace will be trimmed as
      will any trailing whitespace, newlines, carriage returns or EOF
      characters. After such trimming the length of the data in <emphasis role="bold">f</emphasis> must be divisbile by 4. For every 4 input
      bytes exactly 3 output bytes will be produced. The output will be
      padded with 0 bits if necessary to ensure that the output is always 3
      bytes for every 4 input bytes. This function will return the length
      of the data decoded or -1 on error.
