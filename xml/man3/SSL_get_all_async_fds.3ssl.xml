    <para>
      SSL_waiting_for_async() determines whether an SSL connection is
      currently waiting for asynchronous operations to complete (see the
      SSL_MODE_ASYNC mode in <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>SSL_CTX_set_mode</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>).
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_get_all_async_fds() returns a list of file descriptor which can
      be used in a call to select() or poll() to determine whether the
      current asynchronous operation has completed or not. A completed
      operation will result in data appearing as "read ready" on the file
      descriptor (no actual data should be read from the file descriptor).
      This function should only be called if the SSL object is currently
      waiting for asynchronous work to complete (i.e. SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC
      has been received - see <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>SSL_get_error</refentrytitle> <manvolnum>3</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>). Typically the list will only contain one file
      descriptor. However if multiple asynchronous capable engines are in
      use then more than one is possible. The number of file descriptors
      returned is stored in <emphasis role="bold">*numfds</emphasis> and
      the file descriptors themselves are in <emphasis role="bold">*fds</emphasis>. The <emphasis role="bold">fds</emphasis>
      parameter may be NULL in which case no file descriptors are returned
      but <emphasis role="bold">*numfds</emphasis> is still populated. It
      is the callers responsibility to ensure sufficient memory is
      allocated at <emphasis role="bold">*fds</emphasis> so typically this
      function is called twice (once with a NULL <emphasis role="bold">fds</emphasis> parameter and once without).
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_get_changed_async_fds() returns a list of the asynchronous file
      descriptors that have been added and a list that have been deleted
      since the last SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC was received (or since the SSL
      object was created if no SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC has been received).
      Similar to SSL_get_all_async_fds() it is the callers responsibility
      to ensure that <emphasis role="bold">*addfd</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">*delfd</emphasis> have sufficient memory allocated,
      although they may be NULL. The number of added fds and the number of
      deleted fds are stored in <emphasis role="bold">*numaddfds</emphasis>
      and <emphasis role="bold">*numdelfds</emphasis> respectively.

    <para>
      SSL_waiting_for_async() will return 1 if the current SSL operation is
      waiting for an async operation to complete and 0 otherwise.
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_get_all_async_fds() and SSL_get_changed_async_fds() return 1 on
      success or 0 on error.

    <para>
      SSL_waiting_for_async(), SSL_get_all_async_fds() and
      SSL_get_changed_async_fds() were first added to OpenSSL 1.1.0.
