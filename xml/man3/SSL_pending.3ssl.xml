    <para>
      Data is received in whole blocks known as records from the peer. A
      whole record is processed (e.g. decrypted) in one go and is buffered
      by OpenSSL until it is read by the application via a call to
      <citerefentry> <refentrytitle>SSL_read</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>.
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_pending() returns the number of bytes which have been processed,
      buffered and are available inside <emphasis role="bold">ssl</emphasis> for immediate read.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the <emphasis role="bold">SSL</emphasis> object's <emphasis role="italic">read_ahead</emphasis> flag is set (see <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>), additional protocol bytes
      (beyond the current record) may have been read containing more
      TLS/SSL records. This also applies to DTLS and pipelining (see
      <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>). These additional bytes
      will be buffered by OpenSSL but will remain unprocessed until they
      are needed. As these bytes are still in an unprocessed state
      SSL_pending() will ignore them. Therefore it is possible for no more
      bytes to be readable from the underlying BIO (because OpenSSL has
      already read them) and for SSL_pending() to return 0, even though
      readable application data bytes are available (because the data is in
      unprocessed buffered records).
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_has_pending() returns 1 if <emphasis role="bold">s</emphasis> has
      buffered data (whether processed or unprocessed) and 0 otherwise.
      Note that it is possible for SSL_has_pending() to return 1, and then
      a subsequent call to SSL_read() to return no data because the
      unprocessed buffered data when processed yielded no application data
      (for example this can happen during renegotiation). It is also
      possible in this scenario for SSL_has_pending() to continue to return
      1 even after an SSL_read() call because the buffered and unprocessed
      data is not yet processable (e.g. because OpenSSL has only received a
      partial record so far).
    </para>

  <refsection xml:id="ID-af2a4aedd3a33d66b085503c13f66b04"><title>RETURN VALUES</title>
    <para>
      SSL_pending() returns the number of buffered and processed
      application data bytes that are pending and are available for
      immediate read. SSL_has_pending() returns 1 if there is buffered
      record data in the SSL object and 0 otherwise.
