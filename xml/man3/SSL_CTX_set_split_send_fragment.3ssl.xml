    <para>
      Some engines are able to process multiple simultaneous crypto
      operations. This capability could be utilised to parallelise the
      processing of a single connection. For example a single write can be
      split into multiple records and each one encrypted independently and
      in parallel. Note: this will only work in TLS1.1+. There is no
      support in SSLv3, TLSv1.0 or DTLS (any version). This capability is
      known as "pipelining" within OpenSSL.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to benefit from the pipelining capability. You need to have
      an engine that provides ciphers that support this. The OpenSSL
      "dasync" engine provides AES128-SHA based ciphers that have this
      capability. However these are for development and test purposes only.
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_CTX_set_max_send_fragment() and SSL_set_max_send_fragment() set
      the <emphasis role="bold">max_send_fragment</emphasis> parameter for
      SSL_CTX and SSL objects respectively. This value restricts the amount
      of plaintext bytes that will be sent in any one SSL/TLS record. By
      default its value is SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH (16384). These
      functions will only accept a value in the range 512 -
      SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH.
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_CTX_set_max_pipelines() and SSL_set_max_pipelines() set the
      maximum number of pipelines that will be used at any one time. This
      value applies to both "read" pipelining and "write" pipelining. By
      default only one pipeline will be used (i.e. normal non-parallel
      operation). The number of pipelines set must be in the range 1 -
      SSL_MAX_PIPELINES (32). Setting this to a value &gt; 1 will also
      automatically turn on "read_ahead" (see <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>). This is explained further
      below. OpenSSL will only every use more than one pipeline if a
      ciphersuite is negotiated that uses a pipeline capable cipher
      provided by an engine.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pipelining operates slighly differently for reading encrypted data
      compared to writing encrypted data. SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment()
      and SSL_set_split_send_fragment() define how data is split up into
      pipelines when writing encrypted data. The number of pipelines used
      will be determined by the amount of data provided to the SSL_write()
      call divided by <emphasis role="bold">split_send_fragment</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example if <emphasis role="bold">split_send_fragment</emphasis>
      is set to 2000 and <emphasis role="bold">max_pipelines</emphasis> is
      4 then:
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_write called with 0-2000 bytes == 1 pipeline used
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_write called with 2001-4000 bytes == 2 pipelines used
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_write called with 4001-6000 bytes == 3 pipelines used
    </para>
    <para>
      SSL_write called with 6001+ bytes == 4 pipelines used
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">split_send_fragment</emphasis> must always be
      less than or equal to <emphasis role="bold">max_send_fragment</emphasis>. By default it is set to be
      equal to <emphasis role="bold">max_send_fragment</emphasis>. This
      will mean that the same number of records will always be created as
      would have been created in the non-parallel case, although the data
      will be apportioned differently. In the parallel case data will be
      spread equally between the pipelines.
    </para>
    <para>
      Read pipelining is controlled in a slightly different way than with
      write pipelining. While reading we are constrained by the number of
      records that the peer (and the network) can provide to us in one go.
      The more records we can get in one go the more opportunity we have to
      parallelise the processing. As noted above when setting <emphasis role="bold">max_pipelines</emphasis> to a value greater than one,
      <emphasis role="bold">read_ahead</emphasis> is automatically set. The
      <emphasis role="bold">read_ahead</emphasis> parameter causes OpenSSL
      to attempt to read as much data into the read buffer as the network
      can provide and will fit into the buffer. Without this set data is
      read into the read buffer one record at a time. The more data that
      can be read, the more opportunity there is for parallelising the
      processing at the cost of increased memory overhead per connection.
      Setting <emphasis role="bold">read_ahead</emphasis> can impact the
      behaviour of the SSL_pending() function (see <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>SSL_pending</refentrytitle> <manvolnum>3</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>).
    </para>
    <para>
      The SSL_CTX_set_default_read_buffer_len() and
      SSL_set_default_read_buffer_len() functions control the size of the
      read buffer that will be used. The <emphasis role="bold">len</emphasis> parameter sets the size of the buffer. The
      value will only be used if it is greater than the default that would
      have been used anyway. The normal default value depends on a number
      of factors but it will be at least SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH +
      SSL3_RT_MAX_ENCRYPTED_OVERHEAD (16704) bytes.
