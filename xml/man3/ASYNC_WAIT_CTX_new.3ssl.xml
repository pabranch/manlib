    <para>
      For an overview of how asynchronous operations are implemented in
      OpenSSL see <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>ASYNC_start_job</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>. An ASYNC_WAIT_CTX object
      represents an asynchronous "session", i.e. a related set of crypto
      operations. For example in SSL terms this would have a one-to-one
      correspondence with an SSL connection.
    </para>
    <para>
      Application code must create an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX using the
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new() function prior to calling ASYNC_start_job() (see
      <citerefentry> <refentrytitle>ASYNC_start_job</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry>). When the job is started it
      is associated with the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX for the duration of that job.
      An ASYNC_WAIT_CTX should only be used for one ASYNC_JOB at any one
      time, but can be reused after an ASYNC_JOB has finished for a
      subsequent ASYNC_JOB. When the session is complete (e.g. the SSL
      connection is closed), application code cleans up with
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_free().
    </para>
    <para>
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTXs can have "wait" file descriptors associated with
      them. Calling ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() and passing in a pointer
      to an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX in the <emphasis role="bold">ctx</emphasis>
      parameter will return the wait file descriptors associated with that
      job in <emphasis role="bold">*fd</emphasis>. The number of file
      descriptors returned will be stored in <emphasis role="bold">*numfds</emphasis>. It is the caller's responsibility to
      ensure that sufficient memory has been allocated in <emphasis role="bold">*fd</emphasis> to receive all the file descriptors.
      Calling ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() with a NULL <emphasis role="bold">fd</emphasis> value will return no file descriptors but
      will still populate <emphasis role="bold">*numfds</emphasis>.
      Therefore application code is typically expected to call this
      function twice: once to get the number of fds, and then again when
      sufficient memory has been allocated. If only one asynchronous engine
      is being used then noramlly this call will only ever return one fd.
      If multiple asynchronous engines are being used then more could be
      returned.
    </para>
    <para>
      The function ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_fds_have_changed() can be used to detect
      if any fds have changed since the last call time ASYNC_start_job()
      returned an ASYNC_PAUSE result (or since the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX was
      created if no ASYNC_PAUSE result has been received). The <emphasis role="bold">numaddfds</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">numdelfds</emphasis> parameters will be populated with
      the number of fds added or deleted respectively. <emphasis role="bold">*addfd</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">*delfd</emphasis> will be populated with the list of
      added and deleted fds respectively. Similarly to
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() either of these can be NULL, but if they
      are not NULL then the caller is responsible for ensuring sufficient
      memory is allocated.
    </para>
    <para>
      Implementors of async aware code (e.g. engines) are encouraged to
      return a stable fd for the lifetime of the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX in order to
      reduce the "churn" of regularly changing fds - although no guarantees
      of this are provided to applications.
    </para>
    <para>
      Applications can wait for the file descriptor to be ready for "read"
      using a system function call such as select or poll (being ready for
      "read" indicates that the job should be resumed). If no file
      descriptor is made available then an application will have to
      periodically "poll" the job by attempting to restart it to see if it
      is ready to continue.
    </para>
    <para>
      Async aware code (e.g. engines) can get the current ASYNC_WAIT_CTX
      from the job via <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>ASYNC_get_async_wait_ctx</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>3</manvolnum> </citerefentry> and provide a file
      descriptor to use for waiting on by calling
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd(). Typically this would be done by an
      engine immediately prior to calling ASYNC_pause_job() and not by end
      user code. An existing association with a file descriptor can be
      obtained using ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_fd() and cleared using
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_clear_fd(). Both of these functions requires a
      <emphasis role="bold">key</emphasis> value which is unique to the
      async aware code. This could be any unique value but a good candidate
      might be the <emphasis role="bold">ENGINE *</emphasis> for the
      engine. The <emphasis role="bold">custom_data</emphasis> parameter
      can be any value, and will be returned in a subsequent call to
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_fd(). The ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd() function
      also expects a pointer to a "cleanup" routine. This can be NULL but
      if provided will automatically get called when the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX is
      freed, and gives the engine the opportunity to close the fd or any
      other resources. Note: The "cleanup" routine does not get called if
      the fd is cleared directly via a call to ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_clear_fd().
    </para>
    <para>
      An example of typical usage might be an async capable engine. User
      code would initiate cryptographic operations. The engine would
      initiate those operations asynchronously and then call
      ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_wait_fd() followed by ASYNC_pause_job() to return
      control to the user code. The user code can then perform other tasks
      or wait for the job to be ready by calling "select" or other similar
      function on the wait file descriptor. The engine can signal to the
      user code that the job should be resumed by making the wait file
      descriptor "readable". Once resumed the engine should clear the wake
      signal on the wait file descriptor.
