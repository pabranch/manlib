\fBDSYRK\fP \fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 DSYRK  performs one of the symmetric rank k operations

    C := alpha*A*A**T + beta*C,

 or

    C := alpha*A**T*A + beta*C,

 where  alpha and beta  are scalars, C is an  n by n  symmetric matrix
 and  A  is an  n by k  matrix in the first case and a  k by n  matrix
 in the second case.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
           triangular  part  of the  array  C  is to be  referenced  as
           follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the  upper triangular part of  C
                                  is to be referenced.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the  lower triangular part of  C
                                  is to be referenced.

\fITRANS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
           On entry,  TRANS  specifies the operation to be performed as
           follows:

              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   C := alpha*A*A**T + beta*C.

              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   C := alpha*A**T*A + beta*C.

              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   C := alpha*A**T*A + beta*C.

\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry,  N specifies the order of the matrix C.  N must be
           at least zero.

.br
\fIK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          K is INTEGER
           On entry with  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  K  specifies  the number
           of  columns   of  the   matrix   A,   and  on   entry   with
           TRANS = 'T' or 't' or 'C' or 'c',  K  specifies  the  number
           of rows of the matrix  A.  K must be at least zero.

.nf
          ALPHA is DOUBLE PRECISION.
           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
           k  when  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  and is  n  otherwise.
           Before entry with  TRANS = 'N' or 'n',  the  leading  n by k
           part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise
           the leading  k by n  part of the array  A  must contain  the
           matrix A.

\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER
           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
           in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   When  TRANS = 'N' or 'n'
           then  LDA must be at least  max( 1, n ), otherwise  LDA must
           be at least  max( 1, k ).

.nf
          C is DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ).
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the leading  n by n
           upper triangular part of the array C must contain the upper
           triangular part  of the  symmetric matrix  and the strictly
           lower triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
           upper triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
           upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the leading  n by n
           lower triangular part of the array C must contain the lower
           triangular part  of the  symmetric matrix  and the strictly
           upper triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
           lower triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
           lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
