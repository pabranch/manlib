\fB SGGLSE solves overdetermined or underdetermined systems for OTHER matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SGGLSE solves the linear equality-constrained least squares (LSE)
 problem:

         minimize || c - A*x ||_2   subject to   B*x = d

 where A is an M-by-N matrix, B is a P-by-N matrix, c is a given
 M-vector, and d is a given P-vector. It is assumed that
 P <= N <= M+P, and

          rank(B) = P and  rank( (A) ) = N.
                               ( (B) )

 These conditions ensure that the LSE problem has a unique solution,
 which is obtained using a generalized RQ factorization of the
 matrices (B, A) given by

    B = (0 R)*Q,   A = Z*T*Q.

          On entry, C contains the right hand side vector for the
          least squares part of the LSE problem.

\fIWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf

\fILWORK\fP

.nf
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,M+N+P).

          SGEQRF, SGERQF, SORMQR and SORMRQ.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

.nf
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit.

                generalized RQ factorization of the pair (B, A) is
                singular, so that rank(B) < P; the least squares
                solution could not be computed.

                T associated with A in the generalized RQ factorization

                rank( (A) ) < N; the least squares solution could not
                    ( (B) )
                be computed.
