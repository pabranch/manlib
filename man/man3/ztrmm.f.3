\fBZTRMM\fP \fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZTRMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

    B := alpha*op( A )*B,   or   B := alpha*B*op( A )

 where  alpha  is a scalar,  B  is an m by n matrix,  A  is a unit, or
 non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A )  is one  of

    op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A**T   or   op( A ) = A**H.

.RS 4
\fISIDE\fP 
.PP
.nf
          SIDE is CHARACTER*1
           On entry,  SIDE specifies whether  op( A ) multiplies B from
           the left or right as follows:

              SIDE = 'L' or 'l'   B := alpha*op( A )*B.

              SIDE = 'R' or 'r'   B := alpha*B*op( A ).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or
           lower triangular matrix as follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fITRANSA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          TRANSA is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
           the matrix multiplication as follows:

              TRANSA = 'N' or 'n'   op( A ) = A.

              TRANSA = 'T' or 't'   op( A ) = A**T.

              TRANSA = 'C' or 'c'   op( A ) = A**H.

\fIDIAG\fP 
.PP
.nf
          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular
           as follows:

              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.

              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
                                  triangular.

.PP
.br
\fIM\fP 
.PP
.nf
          M is INTEGER
           On entry, M specifies the number of rows of B. M must be at
           least zero.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the number of columns of B.  N must be
           at least zero.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIALPHA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ALPHA is COMPLEX*16
           On entry,  ALPHA specifies the scalar  alpha. When  alpha is
           zero then  A is not referenced and  B need not be set before
           entry.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX*16 array of DIMENSION ( LDA, k ), where k is m
           when  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  and is  n  when  SIDE = 'R' or 'r'.
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the  leading  k by k
           upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
           triangular matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part of
           A is not referenced.
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the  leading  k by k
           lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
           triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
           A is not referenced.
           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u',  the diagonal elements of
           A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER
           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
           in the calling (sub) program.  When  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  then
           LDA  must be at least  max( 1, m ),  when  SIDE = 'R' or 'r'
           then LDA must be at least max( 1, n ).

.br
\fIB\fP 
.PP
.nf
          B is (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array of DIMENSION ( LDB, n ).
           Before entry,  the leading  m by n part of the array  B must
           contain the matrix  B,  and  on exit  is overwritten  by the
           transformed matrix.

\fILDB\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDB is INTEGER
           On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
           in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be  at  least
           max( 1, m ).
