 CGGQRF computes a generalized QR factorization of an N-by-M matrix A
 and an N-by-P matrix B:

             A = Q*R,        B = Q*T*Z,

 where Q is an N-by-N unitary matrix, Z is a P-by-P unitary matrix,
 and R and T assume one of the forms:

 if N >= M,  R = ( R11 ) M  ,   or if N < M,  R = ( R11  R12 ) N,
                 (  0  ) N-M                         N   M-N
                    M

 where R11 is upper triangular, and

 if N <= P,  T = ( 0  T12 ) N,   or if N > P,  T = ( T11 ) N-P,
                  P-N  N                           ( T21 ) P
                                                      P

 where T12 or T21 is upper triangular.

 In particular, if B is square and nonsingular, the GQR factorization
 of A and B implicitly gives the QR factorization of inv(B)*A:

              inv(B)*A = Z**H * (inv(T)*R)

 where inv(B) denotes the inverse of the matrix B, and Z' denotes the
 conjugate transpose of matrix Z.

          RQ factorization of an N-by-P matrix, and NB3 is the optimal
          blocksize for a call of CUNMQR.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

  The matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(n,m).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - taua * v * v**H

  where taua is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(1:i-1) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i+1:n,i),
  and taua in TAUA(i).
  To form Q explicitly, use LAPACK subroutine CUNGQR.
  To use Q to update another matrix, use LAPACK subroutine CUNMQR.

  The matrix Z is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

     Z = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(n,p).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - taub * v * v**H

  where taub is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(p-k+i+1:p) = 0 and v(p-k+i) = 1; v(1:p-k+i-1) is stored on exit in
  B(n-k+i,1:p-k+i-1), and taub in TAUB(i).
  To form Z explicitly, use LAPACK subroutine CUNGRQ.
  To use Z to update another matrix, use LAPACK subroutine CUNMRQ.
