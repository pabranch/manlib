\fB ZHBEVD computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for OTHER matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZHBEVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
 a complex Hermitian band matrix A.  If eigenvectors are desired, it
 uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

 The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
 without guard digits, but we know of none.

          KD is INTEGER

.nf
          AB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB, N)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
          as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).

          On exit, AB is overwritten by values generated during the
          reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the first
          superdiagonal and the diagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T
          are returned in rows KD and KD+1 of AB, and if UPLO = 'L',
          the diagonal and first subdiagonal of T are returned in the
          first two rows of AB.

          eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
          holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
