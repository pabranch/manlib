.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 STBMV  performs one of the matrix-vector operations

    x := A*x,   or   x := A**T*x,

 where x is an n element vector and  A is an n by n unit, or non-unit,
 upper or lower triangular band matrix, with ( k + 1 ) diagonals.

.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
           lower triangular matrix as follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.

          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as
           follows:

              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   x := A*x.

              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   x := A**T*x.

.nf
          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
           triangular as follows:

              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.

              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
                                  triangular.

          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
           N must be at least zero.

\fIK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          K is INTEGER
           On entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', K specifies the number of
           super-diagonals of the matrix A.
           On entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', K specifies the number of
           sub-diagonals of the matrix A.
           K must satisfy  0 .le. K.

          A is REAL array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ).
           Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading ( k + 1 )
           by n part of the array A must contain the upper triangular
           band part of the matrix of coefficients, supplied column by
           column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row
           ( k + 1 ) of the array, the first super-diagonal starting at
           position 2 in row k, and so on. The top left k by k triangle
           of the array A is not referenced.
           The following program segment will transfer an upper
           triangular band matrix from conventional full matrix storage
           to band storage:

                 DO 20, J = 1, N
                    M = K + 1 - J
                    DO 10, I = MAX( 1, J - K ), J
                       A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
              10    CONTINUE
              20 CONTINUE

           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading ( k + 1 )
           by n part of the array A must contain the lower triangular
           band part of the matrix of coefficients, supplied column by
           column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row 1 of
           the array, the first sub-diagonal starting at position 1 in
           row 2, and so on. The bottom right k by k triangle of the
           array A is not referenced.
           The following program segment will transfer a lower
           triangular band matrix from conventional full matrix storage
           to band storage:

                 DO 20, J = 1, N
                    M = 1 - J
                    DO 10, I = J, MIN( N, J + K )
                       A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
              10    CONTINUE
              20 CONTINUE

           Note that when DIAG = 'U' or 'u' the elements of the array A
           corresponding to the diagonal elements of the matrix are not
           referenced, but are assumed to be unity.

          LDA is INTEGER
           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared

          X is REAL array of dimension at least

           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
           element vector x. On exit, X is overwritten with the
           tranformed vector x.
