\fB SSPEVD computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for OTHER matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SSPEVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
 of a real symmetric matrix A in packed storage. If eigenvectors are
 desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

 The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
 without guard digits, but we know of none.

          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

          On exit, AP is overwritten by values generated during the
          reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the diagonal
          and first superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T overwrite
          the corresponding elements of A, and if UPLO = 'L', the
          diagonal and first subdiagonal of T overwrite the
          corresponding elements of A.

          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal

          LDZ is INTEGER

\fIWORK\fP

\fILWORK\fP

.nf
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.
          If N <= 1,               LWORK must be at least 1.
          If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least 2*N.

                                                 1 + 6*N + N**2.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the required sizes of the WORK and IWORK
          arrays, returns these values as the first entries of the WORK
          and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or
          LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

          If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 3 + 5*N.

          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK and
          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
          the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to
