.nf
 CGGHRD reduces a pair of complex matrices (A,B) to generalized upper
 Hessenberg form using unitary transformations, where A is a
 general matrix and B is upper triangular.  The form of the generalized
 eigenvalue problem is
    A*x = lambda*B*x,
 and B is typically made upper triangular by computing its QR
 factorization and moving the unitary matrix Q to the left side
 of the equation.

 This subroutine simultaneously reduces A to a Hessenberg matrix H:
    Q**H*A*Z = H
 and transforms B to another upper triangular matrix T:
    Q**H*B*Z = T
 in order to reduce the problem to its standard form
    H*y = lambda*T*y
 where y = Z**H*x.

 The unitary matrices Q and Z are determined as products of Givens
 rotations.  They may either be formed explicitly, or they may be
 postmultiplied into input matrices Q1 and Z1, so that
      Q1 * A * Z1**H = (Q1*Q) * H * (Z1*Z)**H
      Q1 * B * Z1**H = (Q1*Q) * T * (Z1*Z)**H
 If Q1 is the unitary matrix from the QR factorization of B in the
 original equation A*x = lambda*B*x, then CGGHRD reduces the original
 problem to generalized Hessenberg form.

          reduced.  It is assumed that A is already upper triangular
          in rows and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N.  ILO and IHI are
          normally set by a previous call to CGGBAL; otherwise they
          should be set to 1 and N respectively.
          1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.
