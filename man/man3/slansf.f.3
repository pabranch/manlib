 squares).  Note that  max(abs(A(i,j)))  is not a  matrix norm.

          The order of the matrix A. N >= 0. When N = 0, SLANSF is

  We first consider Rectangular Full Packed (RFP) Format when N is
  even. We give an example where N = 6.

      AP is Upper             AP is Lower

   00 01 02 03 04 05       00
      11 12 13 14 15       10 11
         22 23 24 25       20 21 22
            33 34 35       30 31 32 33
               44 45       40 41 42 43 44
                  55       50 51 52 53 54 55


  Let TRANSR = 'N'. RFP holds AP as follows:
  For UPLO = 'U' the upper trapezoid A(0:5,0:2) consists of the last
  three columns of AP upper. The lower triangle A(4:6,0:2) consists of
  the transpose of the first three columns of AP upper.
  For UPLO = 'L' the lower trapezoid A(1:6,0:2) consists of the first
  three columns of AP lower. The upper triangle A(0:2,0:2) consists of
  the transpose of the last three columns of AP lower.
  This covers the case N even and TRANSR = 'N'.

         RFP A                   RFP A

        03 04 05                33 43 53
        13 14 15                00 44 54
        23 24 25                10 11 55
        33 34 35                20 21 22
        00 44 45                30 31 32
        01 11 55                40 41 42
        02 12 22                50 51 52

  Now let TRANSR = 'T'. RFP A in both UPLO cases is just the
  transpose of RFP A above. One therefore gets:


           RFP A                   RFP A

     03 13 23 33 00 01 02    33 00 10 20 30 40 50
     04 14 24 34 44 11 12    43 44 11 21 31 41 51
     05 15 25 35 45 55 22    53 54 55 22 32 42 52


  We then consider Rectangular Full Packed (RFP) Format when N is
  odd. We give an example where N = 5.

     AP is Upper                 AP is Lower

   00 01 02 03 04              00
      11 12 13 14              10 11
         22 23 24              20 21 22
            33 34              30 31 32 33
               44              40 41 42 43 44


  Let TRANSR = 'N'. RFP holds AP as follows:
  For UPLO = 'U' the upper trapezoid A(0:4,0:2) consists of the last
  three columns of AP upper. The lower triangle A(3:4,0:1) consists of
  the transpose of the first two columns of AP upper.
  For UPLO = 'L' the lower trapezoid A(0:4,0:2) consists of the first
  three columns of AP lower. The upper triangle A(0:1,1:2) consists of
  the transpose of the last two columns of AP lower.
  This covers the case N odd and TRANSR = 'N'.

         RFP A                   RFP A

        02 03 04                00 33 43
        12 13 14                10 11 44
        22 23 24                20 21 22
        00 33 34                30 31 32
        01 11 44                40 41 42

  Now let TRANSR = 'T'. RFP A in both UPLO cases is just the
  transpose of RFP A above. One therefore gets:

           RFP A                   RFP A

     02 12 22 00 01             00 10 20 30 40 50
     03 13 23 33 11             33 11 21 31 41 51
     04 14 24 34 44             43 44 22 32 42 52
