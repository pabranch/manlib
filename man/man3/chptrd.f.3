          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
          On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
          of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
          tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
          superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
          matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
          = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
          written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
          matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
          the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product
          of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in AP,
  overwriting A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau is stored in TAU(i).

  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in AP,
  overwriting A(i+2:n,i), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
