\fBZHECON_ROOK\fP estimates the reciprocal of the condition number fort HE matrices using factorization obtained with one of the bounded diagonal pivoting methods (max 2 interchanges)  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZHECON_ROOK estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
 Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
 A = L*D*L**H computed by CHETRF_ROOK.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
