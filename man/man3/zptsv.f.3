\fB ZPTSV computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for PT matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZPTSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
 A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal
 matrix, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 A is factored as A = L*D*L**H, and the factored form of A is then
 used to solve the system of equations.
