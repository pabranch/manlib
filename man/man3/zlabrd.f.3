\fBZLABRD\fP reduces the first nb rows and columns of a general matrix to a bidiagonal form\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZLABRD reduces the first NB rows and columns of a complex general
 m by n matrix A to upper or lower real bidiagonal form by a unitary
 transformation Q**H * A * P, and returns the matrices X and Y which
 are needed to apply the transformation to the unreduced part of A.

 If m >= n, A is reduced to upper bidiagonal form; if m < n, to lower
 bidiagonal form.

 This is an auxiliary routine called by ZGEBRD

  The matrices Q and P are represented as products of elementary
  reflectors:

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nb)  and  P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(nb)

  Each H(i) and G(i) has the form:

     H(i) = I - tauq * v * v**H  and G(i) = I - taup * u * u**H

  where tauq and taup are complex scalars, and v and u are complex
  vectors.

  If m >= n, v(1:i-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, and v(i:m) is stored on exit in
  A(i:m,i); u(1:i) = 0, u(i+1) = 1, and u(i+1:n) is stored on exit in
  A(i,i+1:n); tauq is stored in TAUQ(i) and taup in TAUP(i).

  If m < n, v(1:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1, and v(i+1:m) is stored on exit in
  A(i+2:m,i); u(1:i-1) = 0, u(i) = 1, and u(i:n) is stored on exit in
  A(i,i+1:n); tauq is stored in TAUQ(i) and taup in TAUP(i).

  The elements of the vectors v and u together form the m-by-nb matrix
  V and the nb-by-n matrix U**H which are needed, with X and Y, to apply
  the transformation to the unreduced part of the matrix, using a block
  update of the form:  A := A - V*Y**H - X*U**H.

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
  with nb = 2:

  m = 6 and n = 5 (m > n):          m = 5 and n = 6 (m < n):

    (  1   1   u1  u1  u1 )           (  1   u1  u1  u1  u1  u1 )
    (  v1  1   1   u2  u2 )           (  1   1   u2  u2  u2  u2 )
    (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )           (  v1  1   a   a   a   a  )
    (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )           (  v1  v2  a   a   a   a  )
    (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )           (  v1  v2  a   a   a   a  )
    (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )

  where a denotes an element of the original matrix which is unchanged,
  vi denotes an element of the vector defining H(i), and ui an element
  of the vector defining G(i).
