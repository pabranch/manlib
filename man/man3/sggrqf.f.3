 SGGRQF computes a generalized RQ factorization of an M-by-N matrix A
 and a P-by-N matrix B:

             A = R*Q,        B = Z*T*Q,

 where Q is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix, Z is a P-by-P orthogonal
 matrix, and R and T assume one of the forms:

 if M <= N,  R = ( 0  R12 ) M,   or if M > N,  R = ( R11 ) M-N,
                  N-M  M                           ( R21 ) N
                                                      N

 where R12 or R21 is upper triangular, and

 if P >= N,  T = ( T11 ) N  ,   or if P < N,  T = ( T11  T12 ) P,
                 (  0  ) P-N                         P   N-P
                    N

 where T11 is upper triangular.

 In particular, if B is square and nonsingular, the GRQ factorization
 of A and B implicitly gives the RQ factorization of A*inv(B):

              A*inv(B) = (R*inv(T))*Z**T

 where inv(B) denotes the inverse of the matrix B, and Z**T denotes the
 transpose of the matrix Z.

          of an M-by-N matrix, NB2 is the optimal blocksize for the
          QR factorization of a P-by-N matrix, and NB3 is the optimal
          blocksize for a call of SORMRQ.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

  The matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(m,n).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - taua * v * v**T

  where taua is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(n-k+i+1:n) = 0 and v(n-k+i) = 1; v(1:n-k+i-1) is stored on exit in
  A(m-k+i,1:n-k+i-1), and taua in TAUA(i).
  To form Q explicitly, use LAPACK subroutine SORGRQ.
  To use Q to update another matrix, use LAPACK subroutine SORMRQ.

  The matrix Z is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

     Z = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(p,n).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - taub * v * v**T

  where taub is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(1:i-1) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(i+1:p) is stored on exit in B(i+1:p,i),
  and taub in TAUB(i).
  To form Z explicitly, use LAPACK subroutine SORGQR.
  To use Z to update another matrix, use LAPACK subroutine SORMQR.
